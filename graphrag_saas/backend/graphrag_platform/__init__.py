"""GraphRAG SaaS platform modules.

This package contains simplified components for building, indexing and
retrieving knowledge from a corpus of documents. It is a direct copy
of the `graphrag_platform` used in earlier iterations, provided here
to enable containerised deployment. The modules include simple
chunking, entity extraction, TF‑IDF retrieval, community and
hierarchical retrieval, and weighted integration.
