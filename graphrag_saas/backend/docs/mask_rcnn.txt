Mask R‑CNN extends Faster R‑CNN by adding a branch for predicting a high‑resolution segmentation mask for each detected object. This simple extension is easy to train and introduces only a small computational overhead, running at about five frames per second. The method achieves top results on the COCO instance segmentation, bounding‑box detection and person keypoint detection tracks, outperforming previous single‑model entries. A key component is the proposed RoIAlign layer, which preserves spatial alignment and enables accurate pixel‑level masks.
