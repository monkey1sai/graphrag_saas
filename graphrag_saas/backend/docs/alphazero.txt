AlphaZero generalizes the AlphaGo Zero algorithm to a reinforcement‑learning system that achieves superhuman performance in chess, shogi and Go. Starting from random play, the algorithm trains a deep neural network to predict move probabilities and position values and uses a Monte Carlo tree search for self‑play. Within 24 hours, the system reaches a superhuman level and defeats world‑champion programs in all three games, without any domain knowledge beyond the rules of the games.
