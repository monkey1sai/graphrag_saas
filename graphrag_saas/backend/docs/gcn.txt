Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) present a scalable method for semi‑supervised learning on graph‑structured data. The authors derive a localized first‑order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, resulting in a layer‑wise propagation rule that operates directly on graphs and scales linearly with the number of edges. This model achieves state‑of‑the‑art results on citation network datasets and can be interpreted as an efficient variant of spectral graph convolutions.
