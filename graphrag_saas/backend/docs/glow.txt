Glow is a flow‑based generative model that introduces invertible 1×1 convolutions for improved performance and ease of training. The model demonstrates significant improvements in log‑likelihood on standard benchmarks and shows that optimising likelihood yields efficient, realistic‑looking image synthesis with a meaningful latent space. Glow provides exact latent‑variable inference and log‑likelihood evaluation, enabling efficient inference and parallelizable synthesis.
