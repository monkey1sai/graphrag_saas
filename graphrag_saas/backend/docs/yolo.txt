You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a unified, real‑time object detection approach that treats detection as a single regression problem rather than a classification pipeline. YOLO is extremely fast and generalizes well across domains; however, it tends to make more localization errors than slower but more precise detectors. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation, enabling real‑time processing at 45 frames per second and even faster in the Fast YOLO variant.
